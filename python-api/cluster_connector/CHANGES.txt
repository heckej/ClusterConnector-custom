=======================================
CHANGES.txt - Cluster Connector NLP API
=======================================

v1.1.2
---------------------------------------
* The method `reply()` no longer expects the argument to contain a `sentence` key as it mistakenly did before.

v1.1.1
---------------------------------------
* When in debugging mode, the exception `StopAsyncIteration` is no longer printed where it occurred before.

v1.1.0
---------------------------------------
* New `authorization` argument in `Connector` and `WebsocketThread`. This argument will become compulsory in a future
  release.

v1.0.2
---------------------------------------
* Security issue related to websocket connection temporarily fixed (same problem as in 1.0.1). A decent fix will
  result in a new major release.
v1.0.1
---------------------------------------
* Security issue related to websocket connection temporarily fixed. A decent fix will result in a new major release.

v1.0.0
---------------------------------------
This version is a major update involving several incompatibility changes related to some attributes and the task/message
protocol.
* Usage of websockets enabled by default.
* Usage of requests no longer supported. Therefore the attributes `use_websocket`, `prefetch` and `fetch_in_background`
  have been removed. Also the specifications of some methods that made use of requests (`get_next_item()` and `reply()`)
  has been updated.
* Support added for general offensiveness test for both questions and answers.
* Nonsense protocol implemented generally.

v0.2.0
---------------------------------------
* Usage of websockets added as connection method instead of GET/POST requests. This is officially still under development,
  so it is disabled by default, but it is greatly encouraged to enable this feature, because future releases will quite
  probably drop support for GET/POST requests.
* New class WebsocketThread added. This class is used in the Connection class and should not be used elsewhere in normal
  circumstances.
* Problems while parsing tasks from the server have been fixed.
* A method to test the validity of a task has been added.
* The method `has_item()` may throw websocket related exceptions from now on.
* Logging debugging information is now available. Use the following statements to enable this:
    ```
        >> import logging, sys
        >> logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stderr, level=logging.DEBUG)
    ```

v0.1.2
---------------------------------------
* Bug solved: `KeyError` occurred because of case sensitiveness in dictionary keys.
* Bug solved: empty responses from server are now handled correctly.

v0.1.1
---------------------------------------
The method `has_task()` now behaves as expected, i.e. it returns whether any tasks are available instead of always True.
