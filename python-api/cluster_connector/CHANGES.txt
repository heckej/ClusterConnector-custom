CHANGES.txt - Cluster Connector NLP API
=======================================

v0.2.0
---------------------------------------
* Usage of websockets added as connection method instead of GET/POST requests. This is officially still under development,
  so it is disabled by default, but it is greatly encouraged to enable this feature, because future releases will quite
  probably drop support for GET/POST requests.
* New class WebsocketThread added. This class is used in the Connection class and should not be used elsewhere in normal
  circumstances.
* Problems while parsing tasks from the server have been fixed.
* A method to test the validity of a task has been added.
* The method `has_item()` may throw websocket related exceptions from now on.
* Logging debugging information is now available. Use the following statements to enable this:
    ```
        >> import logging, sys
        >> logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stderr, level=logging.DEBUG)
    ```

v0.1.2
---------------------------------------
* Bug solved: `KeyError` occurred because of case sensitiveness in dictionary keys.
* Bug solved: empty responses from server are now handled correctly.

v0.1.1
---------------------------------------
The method `has_task()` now behaves as expected, i.e. it returns whether any tasks are available instead of always True.
