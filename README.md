# Cluster Connector
A central point that handles data streams between the separate [Cluster modules](https://github.com/heckej/P-O-Entrepreneurship-Team-A-code).

## About Cluster
For more information about the entire Cluster project, see the [Cluster](https://github.com/heckej/P-O-Entrepreneurship-Team-A-code) code base.

This Cluster Connector solution consists of the Cluster Server, which is separated over several folders and projects, 
among which [ClusterAPI](https://github.com/heckej/P-O-Entrepreneurship-Team-A-ClusterConnector/tree/master/ClusterAPI) and 
[ClusterLogic](https://github.com/heckej/P-O-Entrepreneurship-Team-A-ClusterConnector/tree/master/ClusterLogic) are the most important ones.
There are also client libraries to connect to the server. [`cluster-connector`](https://github.com/heckej/P-O-Entrepreneurship-Team-A-ClusterConnector/tree/master/python-api) connects tools in Python. 
[`ClusterClient`](https://github.com/heckej/P-O-Entrepreneurship-Team-A-ClusterConnector/tree/master/ClusterClient) connects a chatbot client to the server.
